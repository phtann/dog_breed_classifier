# dog_breed_classifier
In this project, we want to train various models (using CNN, model transfer) on existing pictures of dog breeds.

The final deliverable is an app that can:
- recognize the breed of the dog if the picture contains a dog
- provide the closest dog breed if the picture contains a human
- print an error message if the picture neither contains a dog nor a human
